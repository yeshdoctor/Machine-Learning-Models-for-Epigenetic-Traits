# Machine-Learning-Models-for-Epigenetic-Traits
Investigating multi-dimensional relationships between epigenetic marks and gene expression

This python notebook was used to analyze how changes to the epigenetic loci H3K9, H4K16, and H3K27 affect gene expression of the genes MLNR, DKK1, and IGFBPL1.
